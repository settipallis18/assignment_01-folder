# Project A
### Environment
Natural and man-made environmental resources – fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands, marine resources, and agro-ecosystems – provide sustenance and a foundation for social and economic development.  The need to safeguard these resources crosses all borders.  Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. Data here cover forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to the environment are found under data pages for Agriculture & Rural Development, Energy & Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development.

## Climate Change
Climate change is expected to hit developing countries the hardest. Its effects—higher temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and more frequent weather-related disasters—pose risks for agriculture, food, and water supplies. At stake are recent gains in the fight against poverty, hunger and disease, and the lives and livelihoods of billions of people in developing countries. Addressing climate change requires unprecedented global cooperation across borders. The World Bank Group is helping support developing countries and contributing to a global solution, while tailoring our approach to the differing needs of developing country partners.  Data here cover climate systems, exposure to climate impacts, resilience, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use.  Other indicators relevant to climate change are found under other data pages, particularly Environment, Agriculture & Rural Development, Energy & Mining, Health, Infrastructure, Poverty, and Urban Development.


## Step-1
World Development Indicators (WDI) are the World Bank's most comprehensive collection of development data that is comparable across countries. The World Development Indicators is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,400 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators(Health, Education and Economy) going back more than 50 years.


## Step-2 

https://github.com/settipallis18/assignment_01-folder/blob/main/Project%20A/wdx_long%20new%20longggg.csv Analysing the indiccators about Environment and Climate Changes. Performed analysis using distribution charts, scatter plots and line charts over years. From this analysis, I choose the topic Environment & Climate Changes in G20 Countries.

## Step-3
## Climate Vs Population
Based on the topic Environment and Climate Chnages, I am very enthustic to show the changes of climate from past decades. Now a days we all are aware carbon emission and the effects of the green house gases effect on our lives. So it is bases on the population growth?  population in G20 countries over the years 2010 to 2020. The indicators analyzed are :

The list of the G20 Countries are : 'Argentina', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Canada', 'China', 'France', 'Germany', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Korea, Rep.', 'Mexico', 'Russian Federation', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Africa', 'Turkiye', 'United Kingdom' and 'United States'.
 
###Poulation Growth of the G20 countries:
we can observe the population growth between the G20 countries list in the year of 2012

### Carbon Damage
Here we can observe CO2 most damage countries in the list as well as least based on G20 countries selected list.

### Pupulation Growth & CO2 damage of Top 10 countries in a Pie Chart:

### Here we can notice the countries which highest CO2 damage based on population growth in the year of 2012. China, India & South Africe are in the top 3 places

### When we compare from 2010 to 2021 here are the all countries with damage CO2 percentage in the time series

### From the observations, South Africa are the most CO2 damage country and if we notice it clearly it raises from mid to top level from the past decade and the following countries are Federal Russia and India in the year of 2021(highest).
