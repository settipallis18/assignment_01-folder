## Data Analysis with Python

Here the content explained about the python basics, like  what is Data Analysis, Data Analysis with Python and why programming tools like Python, SQL and Pandas are important.

In the following section, we’ll show you a real example of Data Analysis using Python, so you can see the power of it. The following sections will be the ones explaining each tool in detail.

There are two more sections that specially point out. The first one is Section no 3, “Jupyter tutorial”. And also the last section, Python in under 10 minutes.

### What is Data Analysis?

a method for reviewing, cleaning, modeling, and changing data with the aim of finding relevant information, guiding judgments, and assisting in decision-making.

### Data Analysis Tools:

It was divided into two categories:

- a) Auto-managed closed tools: Here the Auto Managed Closed Tools we have Tableau, Qlik, Looker, Zoho analytics and so on.Closed Source , Expensive , Limited , Easy to learn.

- b) Programming Languages: In Programming Languages, python, R, Julia and so on. Open Source ,  Free (or very cheap) , Extremely Powerful, Steep learning curve.

### Why Python for Data Analysis?

- very simple and intuitive to learn
- “correct” language
- powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis)
- free and open source
- amazing community, docs and conferences

### When to choose R?
 
Unfortunately, Python is not always the solution. So sometimes we go with the R language. R is also a great programming language. We prefer Python because it’s easier to get started, and more “general” in the libraries and tools it includes. R has an huge library of statistical functions, and if you’re in a highly technical discipline.

### The Data Analysis Process:

- Data Extraction: SQL, Scrapping, File Formats (CSV, JSON, XML), Consulting APIs, Buying Data, and Distributed Databases.
- Data Cleaning: Missing values and empty data, Data imputation, Incorrect types, Incorrect or invalid values, Outliers and non relevant data, Statistical sanitization.
- Data Wrangling: Hierarchical Data, Handling categorical data, Reshaping and transforming structures, Indexing data for quick access, Merging, combining and joining data.
- Analysis: Exploration, Building statistical models, Visualization and representations, Correlation vs Causation analysis, Hypothesis testing, Statistical analysis, and Reporting
- Action: Building Machine Learning Models, Feature Engineering, Moving ML into production, Building ETL pipelines, Live dashboard and reporting, and Decision making and real-life tests.
